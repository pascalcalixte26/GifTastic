#This program was to help user create buttons to search Gifs

#I decided to have user search favorite athletes

#unfortunately I couldn't get new buttons to rendor gifs of Athlete inputted by user

#I tried creating specific ID for the new rendered buttons to no avail

#The issue with the Submit button overwriting the data-person buttons in the render gifs function

#tried my best to solve on my own.  Pretty sure class went over the solution but didn't bother going back to the solution.  Went off of prior activities.
